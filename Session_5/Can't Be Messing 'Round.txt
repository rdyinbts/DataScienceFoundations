"Can't Be Messing 'Round"

uh uh yeah
craig david

gonna make ya dance to this
gonna make ya dance to this 
this is how we do it one time
into the year 2 0 straight from 9 9

one day minding my own business
girl from the back won't keep her distance
she was all over me
just won't let it be
so i said to her i got a girl at home
she said she didn't want to listen to me
knew what exactly she wanted to be
my baby
i must admit she was getting to me
wating for me
wanting me to hold her oh so tightly

together, forever, wherever, whatever
she said she couldn't find nobody better
wasn't gonna give up on me never
she said

ooh you're looking so fly 
everytime you pass me by
i like the way you move your body
girl i must admit
you're looking real fit
let's chill for a little bit
i know you wanna get with me
girl you know i'm not free

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
come on let me hit it again
come on let me sing it again
won't pretend
can't be messing around with my girlfriend
[repeat]

it seems like every day girl
you wanna be calling me
and when i step outside
you always follow me
you said that you were really feeling sisqo's song
about the thong th thong thong thong did i wanna see
and when you talk like that
you know you're really tempting me
but i got a girl at home
who'll do the same for me
and that's the way it's gotta be gotta be
so listen now lady

ooh i like your profile
the way you talk and your smile
but you gotta understand lady
i'm not cheating on my baby
ooh you know this ain't right
i'm going home to my girl tonight
and i'm sorry that we couldn't get it on
but the love for my girl's too strong

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
come on let me hit it again
come on let me sing it again
won't pretend
can't be messing around with my girlfriend
[repeat]

and you know you got me open
since the day we started talking

when i wake up in the morning
girl it would be you i'm calling
since i met you my phone bill be doubling
but girlfriend you know that money ain't a thing

but it's you that puts me on a natural high
so i, just walked on by
saying my oh my
