    "### It is one thing to automatically detect that a particular word occurs in a text, and to display some words that appear in the same context. However, we can also determine the location of a word in the text: how many words from the beginning it appears. This positional information can be displayed using a dispersion plot. Each stripe represents an instance of a word, and each row represents the entire text. In the figure, we see some striking patterns of word usage over the last 220 years (in an artificial text constructed by joining the texts of the Inaugural Address Corpus end-to-end). You can produce this plot as shown below. As before, take care to get the quotes, commas, brackets and parentheses exactly right."

In this section we will see how to use the computer to count the words in a text in a variety of useful ways. As before, you will jump right in and experiment with the Python interpreter, even though you may not have studied Python systematically yet. Test your understanding by modifying the examples, and trying the exercises in hte assignment.\n",

    "### So Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or \"tokens\". A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters — such as *hairy*, *his*, or *:)* — that we want to treat as a group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase \"to be or not to be\", we are counting occurrences of these sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of *to*, two of *be*, and one each of *or* and *not*. But there are only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase. How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain? To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly differently. The vocabulary of a text is just the *set* of tokens that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of *text3* with the command: *set(text3)*. When you do this, many screens of words will fly past. Now try the following:"

    "### By wrapping sorted() around the Python expression *set(text3)*, we obtain a sorted list of vocabulary items, beginning with various punctuation symbols and continuing with words starting with A. All capitalized words precede lowercase words. We discover the size of the vocabulary indirectly, by asking for the number of items in the set, and again we can use len to obtain this number. Although it has 44,764 tokens, this book has only 2,789 distinct words, or \"word types.\" A *word type* is the form or spelling of the word independently of its specific occurrences in a text — that is, the word considered as a unique item of vocabulary. Our count of 2,789 items will include punctuation symbols, so we will generally call these unique items *types* instead of word types.\n",
    "### Now, let's calculate a measure of the lexical richness of the text. The next example shows us that the number of distinct words is just 6% of the total number of words, or equivalently that each word is used 16 times on average (remember if you're using Python 2, to start with *from __future__ import division*)."

These \"word classes\" are not just the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many language processing tasks. As we will see, they arise from simple analysis of the distribution of words in text. The goal of this section is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) What are lexical categories and how are they used in natural language processing? \n",
    "### 2) What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories? \n",

    "\n",
    "### The process of classifying words into their *parts of speech* and labeling them accordingly is known as *part-of-speech tagging*, *POS-tagging*, or *simply tagging*. Parts of speech are also known as *word classes* or *lexical categories*. The collection of tags used for a particular task is known as a *tagset*. Our emphasis in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically."

    "### Lexical categories like \"noun\" and part-of-speech tags like NN seem to have their uses, but the details will be obscure to many readers. You might wonder what justification there is for introducing this extra level of information. Many of these categories arise from superficial analysis the distribution of words in text. Consider the following analysis involving *woman* (a noun), *bought* (a verb), *over* (a preposition), and *the* (a determiner). The *text.similar()* method takes a word *w*, finds all contexts w1*w*w2, then finds all words *w'* that appear in the same context, i.e. w1*w'*w2."
